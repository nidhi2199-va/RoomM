Title: Meeting Room Booking Portal
Design a Meeting Room Booking Portal for an office that accommodates employees from multiple teams, including Tech, Operations, Sales, and HR. The system should allow employees to book meeting rooms for specific time slots. All rooms are shared among all teams. Employees should be able to:
View available meeting rooms.
Book a meeting room for a specific date and time slot.
Cancel an existing booking.
See a history of their bookings.
The system should also account for the following:
Multiple meeting rooms with varying capacities and equipment (e.g., screen, whiteboards).
Conflict handling when two users try to book the same room simultaneously.
An admin interface for managing rooms and bookings (e.g., adding/removing rooms, viewing all bookings).
